[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
	[] crash?
	[] infinite loop when it should not?
	[] only work in printed mode?
	[X] work fine?
	[] only implement these options: [list them below]
	[] other? Explain below.


How does your move algorithm work? Describe briefly in English.

- search for 'e' and 'n' moving left to right, top to bottom
- if a happiness is less than the strength preference, attempt to move
- search for a '.' spot moving left to right, top to bottom
- a hypothetical happiness ratings are caclulated at vacant spots
- if the hypothetical is greater than the current happiness, the move executes
- old location is marked with a '*' to prevent any others moving there during the cycle
- '*' marks are cleared at the end of the cycle


============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?

- most inhabitants will want to move each cycle
- getting a rating close to 1 is hard


============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

- Command line argument processing.
- array shuffles
- working with arrays in c


What was easy about this assignment?

- calculating happiness values for each inhabitant
- setting up the 2D city array
- iterating through the 2D city array 


What gave you problems or troubles?

- shuffles on a 2D array (I ended up using a 1D and projecting it)
- moving algorithm
- command line arguments were tedious to set up


What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?

- I'm not comfortable with structs, pointers, and mallocs yet
- more coverage on these topics before the project would have been beneficail


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

- I wanted to use structs to hold the city and its stats, but wasn't comfortable
- I forgot to use the git vcs up until the final stages of the project
