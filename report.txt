[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
	[] crash?
	[] infinite loop when it should not?
	[] only work in printed mode?
	[X] work fine?
	[] only implement these options: [list them below]
	[] other? Explain below.


How does your move algorithm work? Describe briefly in English.

Start at top left looking for 'e' or 'n' moving left to right top to bottom.
If an inhabitant's happiness is less than the given (or default), a move is attempted.
Starting at top left looking for a vacant spot, moving left to right top to bottom.
A hypothetical happiness is calculated that shows what it would be if the inhabitant moved there. 
If the new happiness rating is greater than or equal to the current, the moves takes place.
The old spot is marked with a '*' to prevent any others from moving there during the cycle.


============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?

- most inhabitants will want to move each cycle
- getting a rating close to 1 is hard


============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

- Command line argument processing.
- array shuffles
- working with arrays in c


What was easy about this assignment?

- calculating happiness values for each inhabitant
- setting up the 2D city array
- iterating through the 2D city array 


What gave you problems or troubles?

- shuffles on a 2D array (I ended up using a 1D and projecting it)
- moving algorithm
- command line arguments were tedious to set up


What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?

- I'm not comfortable with structs, pointers, and mallocs yet
- more coverage on these topics before the project is introduced


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

- I wanted to use structs to hold the city and its stats
